This is the proposal of an ontology describing concepts which could be covered by the term "charter" in the sense of the scholarly research area of diplomatics. It implements some concepts established by the community in the Vocabulaire Initernationale de la Diplomatique (http://www.cei.lmu.de/VID/) in RDF/OWL.
It is the result of paper presented at a workshop held Maynooth University on "Versioning Cultural Objects", December 2/3, 2016 (thanks Roman Bleier and Vinayak Das Gupta for organizing it!)

        abstract = {This chapter proposes a model for the concept of versions and how it can be applied in the scholarly discipline of diplomatics, the study of historical legal documents. It describes the various concepts and physical things the discipline of diplomatics connects with the term charter, as well as the practice of people working with them. The chapter also connects the history of preparing, engrossing and copying charters, with the archival and scholarly practices of describing, editing, or photographing, including transforming charters into digital representations.
By drawing on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographical Records (FRBR),
the Vocabulaire Internationale de la Diplomatique, and charter databases such as monasterium.net and The Making of Charlemagne?s Europe, the author argues that a model for versions of charters should not start with a definition of charter, but rather with the network of relationships which can be considered instantiations of versioning. W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) representations of the data fragments used to represent a charter{--}for example images, descriptions, texts, legal actions, archival and other identifiers{--}allow a giant graph of charter versions to be created and help to use and approach the rich set of charter databases as integrated resource.}
